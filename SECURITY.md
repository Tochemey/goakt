# Reporting Security Issues

At GoAkt, both the core team and community place high importance on addressing security vulnerabilities. We value
responsible disclosure and are committed to recognizing those who help us improve.

If you discover a potential security flaw, please submit it through GitHub using
the ["Report a Vulnerability"](https://github.com/Tochemey/goakt/security/advisories/new) feature.

Once your report is received, we'll respond with the next steps. Throughout the resolution process, weâ€™ll keep you
updated on progress and may reach out for further details or clarification.

For vulnerabilities found in third-party dependencies, please report them directly to the maintainers of the affected
module via their repository.
