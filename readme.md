Distributed [Go](https://go.dev/) actor framework to build reactive and distributed system in golang using
_**protocol buffers as actor messages**_.

GoAkt is highly scalable and available when running in cluster mode. It comes with the necessary features require to
build a distributed actor-based system without
sacrificing performance and reliability. With GoAkt, you can instantly create a fast, scalable, distributed system across a cluster of computers.

If you are not familiar with the actor model, the blog post from Brian
Storti [here](https://www.brianstorti.com/the-actor-model/) is an excellent and short introduction to the actor model.
Also, check reference section at the end of the post for more material regarding actor model.

## Features

- Send a synchronous message to an actor from a non actor system
- Send an asynchronous(fire-and-forget) message to an actor from a non actor system
- Actor to Actor communication (check the [examples'](./examples/actor-to-actor) folder)
- Enable/Disable Passivation mode to remove/keep idle actors
- PreStart hook for an actor.
- PostStop hook for an actor for a graceful shutdown
- ActorSystem: Actors live and die within a system.
- Actor to Actor communication via Tell and Ask message patterns.
- Restart(a.k.a. ReSpawn) an actor
- (Un)Watch an actor
- Stop(a.k.a. Kill) and actor
- Child actor (Spawn and Kill)
- Supervisory Strategy (Restart and Stop directive are supported)
- Logger interface with a default logger
- Integration with [OpenTelemetry](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-go) for traces and metrics.
- Remoting
    - Actors can send messages to other actors on a remote system via Tell and Ask message patterns.
    - Actors can look up other actors' address on a remote system.
- Clustering that offers simple scalability, partitioning (sharding), and re-balancing out-of-the-box.
- [Mock interfaces](./goaktmocks) to test GoAkt-based actors.

## Installation

```bash
go get github.com/tochemey/goakt
```

## Actors

Actors in Go-Akt live within an actor system. They can be _long-lived_ actors or be _passivated_ after some period of
time
depending upon the configuration set during their creation. To create an actor one need to implement
the [`Actor`](./actors/actor.go) interface.
Actors in Go-Akt use _Google Protocol Buffers_ message as a mean of communication. The choice of protobuf is due to easy
serialization over wire
and strong schema definition.

In Go-Akt, actors have the following characteristics:

- Each actor has a process id [`PID`](./actors/pid.go). Via the process id any allowable action can be executed by the
  actor.
- Lifecycle via the following methods: [`PreStart`](./actors/actor.go), [`PostStop`](./actors/actor.go). It means they
  can live and die like any other process.
- They handle and respond to messages via the method [`Receive`](./actors/actor.go). While handling messages they can:
    - Create other (child) actors via their process id [`PID`](./actors/pid.go) `SpawnChild` method
    - Send messages to other actors via their process id [`PID`](./actors/pid.go) `Ask`, `RemoteAsk`(request/response
      fashion) and `Tell`, `RemoteTell`(fire-and-forget fashion) methods
    - Stop (child) actors via their process id [`PID`](./actors/pid.go)
    - Watch/Unwatch (child) actors via their process id [`PID`](./actors/pid.go) `Watch` and `UnWatch` methods
    - Supervise the failure behavior of (child) actors. The supervisory strategy to adopt is set during the creation of
      the actor system. (Restart and Stop directive are supported) at the moment
    - Remotely lookup for an actor on another node via their process id [`PID`](./actors/pid.go) `RemoteLookup`. This
      allows them to send messages remotely via `RemoteAsk` or `RemoteTell` methods
- They can adopt various form using the [behavior](./actors/behavior.go) feature
- Few metrics are also accessible:
    - Mailbox size at a given time. That information can be accessed via the process
      id  [`PID`](./actors/pid.go) `MailboxSize` method
    - Total number of messages handled at a given time. That information can be accessed via the process
      id  [`PID`](./actors/pid.go) `ReceivedCount` method
    - Total number of restart. This is accessible via the process id  [`PID`](./actors/pid.go) `RestartCount` method
    - Total number of panic attacks. This is accessible via the process id [`PID`](./actors/pid.go) `ErrorsCount` method

## ActorSystem

Without an actor system, it is not possible to create actors in Go-Akt. Only a single actor system is allowed to be
created per node when using Go-Akt.
To create an actor system one just need to use the [`NewActorSystem`](./actors/actor_system.go) method with the
various [options](./actors/option.go).

## Observability

The actor and actor-system metrics as well traces are accessible via the integration
with [OpenTelemetry](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-go).

## Clustering

The cluster engine depends upon the [discovery](./discovery/provider.go) mechanism to find other nodes in the cluster.
Under the hood, it leverages [Olric](https://github.com/buraksezer/olric)
to scale out and guarantee performant, reliable persistence, simple scalability, partitioning (sharding), and
re-balancing out-of-the-box.

At the moment the following providers are implemented:

* the [kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/docs/home/) [api integration](./discovery/kubernetes) is fully functional.
* the [mDNS](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6762) and [DNS-SD](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6763)

In addition, one needs to set the following environment variables irrespective of the discovery provider to help
identify the host node on which the cluster service is running:

* `NODE_NAME`: the node name. For instance in kubernetes one can just get it from the `metadata.name`
* `NODE_IP`: the node host address. For instance in kubernetes one can just get it from the `status.podIP`
* `GOSSIP_PORT`: the gossip protocol engine port.
* `CLUSTER_PORT`: the cluster port to help communicate with other GoAkt nodes in the cluster
* `REMOTING_PORT`: help remoting communication between actors

### Operations Guide

The following outlines the cluster mode operations which can help have a healthy GoAkt cluster:

* One can start a single node cluster or a multiple nodes cluster.
* One can add more nodes to the cluster which will automatically discover the cluster.
* One can remove nodes. However, to avoid losing data, one need to scale down the cluster to the minimum number of nodes
  which started the cluster.

### Discovery Providers

* [Kubernetes](./docs/kubernetes.md)
* [mDNS](./docs/mdns.md)
