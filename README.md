Distributed [Go](https://go.dev/) actor framework to build a reactive and distributed system in golang using
_**protocol buffers**_ as actor messages.

GoAkt is highly scalable and available when running in cluster mode. It comes with the necessary features require to
build a distributed actor-based system without sacrificing performance and reliability. With GoAkt, you can instantly create a fast, scalable, distributed system
across a cluster of computers.

If you are not familiar with the actor model, the blog post from Brian Storti [here](https://www.brianstorti.com/the-actor-model/) is an excellent and short introduction to the actor model.
Also, check the reference section at the end of the post for more material regarding the actor model.
