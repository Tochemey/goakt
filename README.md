Distributed [Go](https://go.dev/) actor framework to build a reactive and distributed system in Go with typed actor messages. 
GoAkt is highly scalable and available when running in cluster mode. It comes with the necessary features require to
build a distributed actor-based system without sacrificing performance and reliability. With GoAkt, you can instantly create a fast, scalable, distributed system
across a cluster of computers.

If you are not familiar with the actor model, the blog post from Brian Storti [here](https://www.brianstorti.com/the-actor-model/) is an excellent and short introduction to the actor model.
Also, check the reference section at the end of the post for more material regarding the actor model.

> **Version & branches**
>
> - **v3** — Protocol buffers for actor messages. Branch: [`release/3.14`](https://github.com/Tochemey/goakt/tree/release/3.14).
> - **v4** — Typed messages with `any`, unified APIs, pluggable serializers (Proto/CBOR), and config-only remoting. See [CHANGELOG_V400.md](./CHANGELOG_V400.md) for migration; [Docs](https://docs.goakt.dev/) for API reference.

## ✨ Features

- **Actor Model**: Build concurrent and distributed systems using the actor model with typed messages.
- **Messaging**: Tell/Ask APIs for fire-and-forget or request/response flows.
- **Reentrancy**: Reentrancy-enabled async request messaging with configurable modes and per-call overrides.
- **Supervision**: One-for-one/one-for-all strategies, directives, and retry windows for fault tolerance.
- **Remoting**: Seamless communication between actors across nodes over TCP.
- **Context Propagation**: Pluggable context propagation for request-scoped metadata.
- **Clustering**: Multiple discovery backends (Consul, etcd, Kubernetes, NATS, mDNS, static).
- **Location Transparency**: Interact with actors without needing to know their physical location.
- **Relocation**: Automatic actor relocation on node failure with configurable policies.
- **Cluster Singletons**: Run a single instance across the cluster with guardian-based lifecycle.
- **Grains**: Virtual actors capabilities.
- **Passivation**: Automatically stop idle actors and reclaim resources.
- **Routers**: Routing strategies such as round robin, random, and fan-out.
- **Scheduling**: Timers and delayed messaging built into the runtime.
- **Stashing & Mailboxes**: Stash buffers and customizable mailboxes (bounded/unbounded, priority).
- **Dependency Injection**: Attach runtime dependencies to actors at spawn time.
- **Observability**: OpenTelemetry metrics, event stream, and dead letters.
- **Extensions**: Pluggable APIs for cross-cutting capabilities.
- **Data Center**: Multi-datacenter support with DC-transparent messaging, pluggable control plane (NATS JetStream, Etcd), DC-aware placement (SpawnOn with WithDataCenter), and cross-DC actor/grain communication.
- **Reactive Streams**: Actor-backed, backpressure-aware stream processing with a composable DSL. Includes rich sources (channels, actors, ticks, network I/O, unfold), transformations (map, filter, flatMap, batch, throttle, deduplicate, scan, parallel map), and sinks (forEach, collect, fold, actor forwarding). Supports fan-out (broadcast, balance), fan-in (merge, combine), non-linear graph topologies, configurable error strategies (fail-fast, resume, retry), overflow strategies, automatic stage fusion, and built-in metrics and tracing hooks.
