// ResumePassivation is a system-level message used to resume the passivation of an actor.

// to complete critical tasks or handle important messages, and now it can return to its normal
// passivation behavior. This is a fire-and-forget message, so it does not expect a response.
//
// This will no-op if the actor does not have passivation enabled.

// GetRoutees requests a snapshot of the router’s current routee set.
//
// Usage:
//   - Send with Ask to a router PID to retrieve the list of active routee names.
//   - The router replies with a Routees message. If no routees are available, the list is empty.
//
// Scope and consistency:
//   - Routers are local to an actor system; this message is only valid within the same process/system.
//   - The returned list is a point-in-time snapshot.
//
// Resolving names:
//   - Use ActorSystem.LocalActor (or LocalActor) to resolve a returned name to a local PID/reference.
//   - Names are unique within the router’s namespace.
message GetRoutees {}

// Routees contains the set of routee names managed by a router at the time of the GetRoutees request.
//
// Semantics:
//   - names represents the router’s best-effort snapshot when the request was handled.
//   - A name can be resolved to a local PID/reference via ActorSystem.LocalActor (or LocalActor).
//   - Since routers are locally scoped, these names are not valid across different actor systems or nodes.
//
// Example (Go):
//   resp, err := ctx.Ask(routerPID, &goaktpb.GetRoutees{}, 500*time.Millisecond)
//   if err == nil {
//       r := resp.(*goaktpb.Routees)
//       for _, name := range r.GetNames() {
//           if pid := ctx.ActorSystem().LocalActor(name); pid != nil {
//               ctx.Tell(pid, &MyMessage{})
//           }

// AdjustRouterPoolSize requests a runtime delta resize of a router's routee pool.
//
// Semantics (delta-based):
//   - pool_size > 0: Scale up by pool_size (spawn that many additional routees).
//   - pool_size < 0: Scale down by |pool_size| (stop that many existing routees).
//   - pool_size == 0: No-op.
//
// Notes:
//   - The resulting pool size never goes below 0. If |pool_size| exceeds the current size, the pool becomes 0.
//   - This is not idempotent: sending +N twice grows by 2N. Prefer absolute-size semantics at the call site if needed.
//   - Resizes are processed in mailbox order; intermediate sizes may be observed while scaling is in progress.
//   - Routing continues during resize using currently available routees.
//
// Constraints:
//   - Negative values are allowed and indicate downsizing.
//   - Routees are local to the actor system hosting the router.
//   - Supervisory directives (restart/resume/stop) apply to failures, not to normal downsizing.
//
// Verification:
//   - Use GetRoutees after some delay to observe effective membership.
//
// Examples (Go):
//   // Grow by 5
//   ctx.Tell(routerPID, &goaktpb.AdjustRouterPoolSize{PoolSize: 5})
//   // Shrink by 3
//   ctx.Tell(routerPID, &goaktpb.AdjustRouterPoolSize{PoolSize: -3})
message AdjustRouterPoolSize {
  // Signed delta of routees to apply:
  //   > 0 increases the pool by this many,
  //   < 0 decreases it by the absolute value,
  //   = 0 is a no-op.
