// Dependency defines the contract for an actor's external dependency within the actor system.
//
// A Dependency represents a service, resource, or capability that an actor interacts with
// during its lifecycle. Dependencies are critical to the actor’s runtime behavior and are
// managed centrally through the system’s dependency registry.
//
// Implementations of Dependency must be serializable to enable dynamic management, persistence,
// and reconstruction of dependencies during actor restarts, migrations, or failovers.
//
// Typical examples of dependencies include:
//   - Database or cache clients (e.g., PostgreSQL, Redis)
//   - External API clients (e.g., Payment gateways, Authentication services)
//   - Configuration providers
//   - Internal utility services (e.g., Metrics collectors)
//
// All Dependency implementations must be registered with the actor system to support their
// recreation and lifecycle management.
//
// Dependency extends Serializable to guarantee that each instance can be transported or persisted
// safely across system boundaries.
type Dependency interface {
	Serializable
	// ID returns the unique identifier for the extension.
	//
	// The identifier must:
	//   - Be no more than 255 characters long.
	//   - Start with an alphanumeric character [a-zA-Z0-9].
	//   - Contain only alphanumeric characters, hyphens (-), or underscores (_) thereafter.
	//
	// Identifiers that do not meet these constraints are considered invalid.
	ID() string
}

// Serializable defines the contract for types that can be serialized to and deserialized from binary form.
//
// Serializable types must implement both encoding.BinaryMarshaler and encoding.BinaryUnmarshaler,
// ensuring compatibility with standard binary encoding mechanisms.
//
// This guarantees that serialized representations of Dependencies and their arguments are portable,
// efficient, and suitable for storage or transmission across the network.
