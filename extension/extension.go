package extension

// Extension defines a pluggable interface that can be injected into the ActorSystem
// to extend its core functionality with custom or domain-specific behavior.
//
// Extensions provide a powerful mechanism to augment the actor system with capabilities
// not available out-of-the-boxâ€”such as support for event sourcing, metrics, distributed tracing,
// or dependency injection.
//
// Once registered, an Extension becomes accessible from any actor's message context,
// making it easy to share cross-cutting concerns across the system.
//
// Example use case:
//   - Injecting an event sourcing engine
//   - Registering a metrics recorder
//   - Adding a service registry client
//
// Extensions must implement the ID method to uniquely identify themselves within the ActorSystem.
type Extension interface {
	// ID returns the unique identifier for the extension.
	//
	// The identifier must:
	//   - Be no more than 255 characters long.
	//   - Start with an alphanumeric character [a-zA-Z0-9].
	//   - Contain only alphanumeric characters, hyphens (-), or underscores (_) thereafter.
	//
	// Identifiers that do not meet these constraints are considered invalid.
	ID() string
