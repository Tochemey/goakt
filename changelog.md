# Changelog

## [Unreleased]

### 🐛 Fixes
- 🔧 Fix and simplify the implementation of the relocation engine.
- 🛡️ Harden the cluster singleton implementation with well guided godoc
- 📦 Exposed the eventstream package that was accidentally moved into the internal package
- 🐛 Fix actor relocation race condition when nodes leave the cluster. Peer state is now persisted to all cluster peers via RPC before leaving membership, ensuring state is available for relocation when NodeLeft events are processed. BoltDB store now ensures immediate read-after-write visibility to prevent timing issues. All shutdown errors (preShutdown, persistence, cluster cleanup) are properly tracked and returned.
- Upgrade Go version to from 1.25.3 to 1.25.5 due to some dependencies upgrades requiring it.

### ✨ Features
- 🔌 Added `Dependencies()` and `Dependency(dependencyID string) ` to `GrainContext` to access the grain's dependency container.
- ⚙️ Added `Extensions()` and `Extension(extensionID string)` to `GrainContext` to access grain extensions.
- 🔌 Added ` Dependencies()` and `Dependency(dependencyID string)` to `ReceiveContext` to access the actor's dependency container.
- ⬆️ Upgrade Go version to from 1.25.3 to 1.25.5 due to some dependencies upgrades requiring it.

## [v3.12.1] - 2026-06-01

### ✨ Features
- 🔁 Added reentrancy-enabled request messaging (`Request`/`RequestName`) with configurable modes (AllowAll/StashNonReentrant), per-call overrides/timeouts, and per-actor in-flight limits; replies are delivered via `Response` and in-flight requests are canceled on restart/passivation.
- 🔌 Added GrainContext async piping helpers (`PipeToGrain`, `PipeToActor`, `PipeToSelf`) for off-mailbox work with optional timeout/circuit breaker controls.

## [v3.12.0] - 2025-31-12

### ✨ Features
- 🧭 `SpawnOn` now uses the system-wide default supervisor strategy configured via `WithDefaultSupervisor`.
- 🧭 Added `WithDefaultSupervisor` to configure the ActorSystem-wide default supervisor strategy.

### 🐛 Fixes
- 🧱 Grain activation flow revamped to prevent panics and duplicate activations.
- ♻️ Added recovery handling for Grain activation/deactivation failures.
- 🕒 `ScheduleOnce` now reliably triggers.
- 🧮 Actor count tracking fixed to avoid mismatch/underflow/overflow.

### ⚙️ Improvements & Refactors
- ⚖️ Cluster engine now emits topology change events resiliently when stable/healthy; added `WithClusterBalancerInterval` in `ClusterConfig`.
- 📦 Moved supervisor code into its own `supervisor` package (replace `actor` with `supervisor` in existing code).
- 🧵 Relocation avoids relocating child actors during the relocation process.
- 🧬 Relocation now preserves each actor's configured supervisor strategy.
- 🔁 Restart behavior revamped to restart the full child family tree.
- 🧰 Address and PID internals revamped; guardrails and ID utilities cleaned up.
- 🧵 Cluster singleton spawning made more resilient with stronger error handling.
- 🗄️ Cluster storage BoltDB file creation reworked.
- 📴 Reduced log noise during actor system shutdown.
- 🧹 General internal maintenance and cleanup.

### 🧪 Tests & Examples
- 🧷 Expanded test coverage across grains, remoting, cluster singletons, and supervision flows.
- 🧭 Added playground scenarios for regression coverage and issue reproduction (e.g., 1017, 1022, 1031, 1036).

### 📚 Documentation
- 📘 README updated with a full feature list.

### 📦 Dependencies
- ⬆️ Cluster engine dependency upgraded.
- 🔄 Routine dependency maintenance updates.
