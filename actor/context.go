// It embeds the standard context.Context interface and grants access to the ActorSystem
// that manages the actor's lifecycle.
//
// Use Context to:
//   - Access the actor's system-wide services and dependencies.
//   - Retrieve deadlines, cancellation signals, and request-scoped values
//     through the embedded context.Context.
//
// A Context is guaranteed to be available during the actorâ€™s initialization phase
// and should be treated as immutable.

// that the actor may interact with during its lifecycle.

// event sourcing, metrics, tracing, or custom application services, directly from the Context.

//
//	logger := x.Extension("extensionID").(MyExtension)
//

//   - extensionID: A unique string identifier used when the extension was registered.
//
// Returns:
//   - extension.Extension: The corresponding extension if found, or nil otherwise.

// These dependencies are typically injected at actor initialization (via SpawnOptions)
// and made accessible during the actor's lifecycle. They can include services, clients,

// This method is useful for diagnostic tools, dynamic inspection, or cases where
// an actor needs to introspect its environment.

// Returns: A slice of Dependency instances associated with this PID.
