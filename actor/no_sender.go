// is meaningful only for local messaging and is not routable across the network.
//
// In remote scenarios use address.NoSender(), which encodes the appropriate
// network address semantics for a no-sender value.
//
// Notes:
//   - The returned PID should be used as the Sender in envelopes, not as a target
//     destination for Send operations.
//   - The value is stable for local use and intended to explicitly indicate the
//     absence of a sender (as opposed to nil).
