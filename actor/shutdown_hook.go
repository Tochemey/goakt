// ShutdownHook defines the interface for a coordinated shutdown hook.
//
// A ShutdownHook is executed during the shutdown process of an ActorSystem to perform cleanup,
// resource release, or other termination logic. Implementations should provide the Execute method
// to define the shutdown behavior, and Recovery to specify error handling and retry strategies.
//
// Example:
//
//	type MyShutdownHook struct{}
//
//	func (h *MyShutdownHook) Execute(ctx context.Context, actorSystem ActorSystem) error {
//	    // custom shutdown logic
//	    return nil
//	}
//
//	func (h *MyShutdownHook) Recovery() *ShutdownHookRecovery {
//	    return NewShutdownHookRecovery(
//	        WithShutdownHookRetry(2, time.Second),
//	        WithShutdownHookRecoveryStrategy(ShouldRetryAndSkip),
//	    )
//	}

	// Parameters:
	//   - ctx:         The context for cancellation and deadlines.
	//   - actorSystem: The ActorSystem being shut down.
	//
	// Returns:
	//   - error: An error if the shutdown logic fails, or nil on success.

	// This determines how failures are handled, including retry and recovery strategies.

	//   - *ShutdownHookRecovery: The recovery configuration for this hook.

// RecoveryStrategy defines the strategy to apply when a ShutdownHook fails during the shutdown process.
//
// This policy determines how the shutdown sequence should proceed if a hook returns an error.
// It allows fine-grained control over error handling, including whether to halt, retry, skip, or combine these actions.
//
// The available policies are:
//   - ShouldFail:         Stop execution and report the error.
//   - ShouldRetryAndFail: Retry the failed hook, then stop if still unsuccessful.
//   - ShouldSkip:         Skip the failed hook and continue with the next.
//   - ShouldRetryAndSkip: Retry the failed hook, then skip and continue if still unsuccessful.
