# Logsm

Logsm is an LSM Tree storage to help GoAkt large cluster handle peer data efficiently while delivering optimum performance.
Instead of rebuling everything from scratch, after some research on the internet I came accross this blog https://dev.to/justlorain/building-an-lsm-tree-storage-engine-from-scratch-3eom
that explained the concept well enough with a fully fledged implementation. Therefore, the Logsm implementation is based upon that with some minor changes.
