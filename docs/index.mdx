sidebarTitle: "🏠 Introduction"
---

GoAkt is a distributed actor framework for Go, inspired by Erlang and Akka. It enables you to build reactive and
distributed systems with typed actor messages. From **v4.0.0** onward, any Go type can be used as actor messages—no
protocol buffers required.

This documentation is designed for both **users** getting started with the framework and **collaborators** contributing
to the project. It focuses on concepts, architecture, and efficient usage patterns rather than exhaustive code examples.

## What's New in v4.0.0

- **Unified APIs**: Single actor reference (`*PID`), single lookup (`ActorOf`), unified scheduler
- **Type flexibility**: `any` replaces `proto.Message` across all message-passing surfaces
- **Pluggable serialization**: ProtoSerializer (default) and CBORSerializer for arbitrary Go types
- **Simplified remoting**: Config-only public API; client is internal
- **Path interface**: Location-transparent actor identity replacing `*address.Address`

## Requirements

- Go 1.26 or higher
