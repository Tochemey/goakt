| **Actor**              | Fundamental unit of computation. Isolated entity that processes messages sequentially and communicates via message passing.                                                                         |
| **ActorSystem**        | Top-level runtime hosting actors. Manages lifecycle, messaging, clustering, remoting. See [Actor System](../actor/actor-system.md).                                                              |
| **PID**                | Process identifier. Live handle to a running actor. Used for Tell, Ask, and all interactions.                                                                                                       |
| **Path**               | Canonical location of an actor: `goakt://system@host:port/path/to/actor`. Returned by `pid.Path()`.                                                                                                 |
| **Grain**              | Virtual actor. Identity-addressed; framework manages activation and passivation.                                                                                                                    |
| **Mailbox**            | Per-actor message queue. Messages enqueued by senders, dequeued by the processing goroutine.                                                                                                        |

| **Event Stream**       | In-process mechanism for system and cluster events (ActorStarted, NodeJoined, Deadletter, etc.). Subscribers use `Subscribe()` and `Iterator()`. See [Event Streams](../advanced/event-streams.md). |
| **PubSub**             | Application-level topic-based messaging. Topic actor manages Subscribe/Unsubscribe/Publish. Requires `WithPubSub()` or cluster. See [PubSub](../advanced/pubsub.md).                                |
