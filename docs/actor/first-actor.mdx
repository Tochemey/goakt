This guide walks through the flow of creating an actor system, spawning an actor, and sending messages. For the full ActorSystem API and configuration, see [Actor System](/actor/actor-system).

## Flow

1. **Create** an actor system with `NewActorSystem` and `Start`
2. **Spawn** an actor with `Spawn(ctx, name, actor)` → receive a `*PID`
3. **Send** messages with `NoSender().Tell` (fire-and-forget) or `NoSender().Ask` (request-response)
4. **Shutdown** with `Stop` when the application exits

## Actor interface

Implement the `Actor` interface to define your actor. See [Actor Model](/actor/actor-model#the-actor-interface)
for the full interface and method explanations.

## Messaging from outside

From outside the actor system (e.g., `main`), use `NoSender()` to send:

- **Tell** — Fire-and-forget. No response expected.
- **Ask** — Request-response. Blocks until reply or timeout. The actor must call `ctx.Response(resp)` to complete the
  request.

## Replying from an actor

When handling a message sent via `Ask`, call `ctx.Response(resp)` exactly once. The caller receives that value. For
`Tell`, no reply is expected.

## ReceiveContext

Inside `Receive`, `ctx` provides:

| Method                  | Purpose                                                  |
|-------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| `Message()`             | The message being processed                              |
| `Sender()`              | PID of the sender (nil for scheduled or system messages) |
| `Self()`                | PID of the current actor                                 |
| `Tell(to, msg)`         | Send fire-and-forget to another actor                    |
| `Ask(to, msg, timeout)` | Send request-response                                    |
| `Response(resp)`        | Reply to an Ask                                          |
| `Unhandled()`           | Mark message as unhandled                                |
